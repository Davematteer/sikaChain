# üì± SikaChain: USSD-Based Digital Currency on the Internet Computer

SikaChain is a USSD-driven mobile money and digital wallet experience, built on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. It leverages **canisters** for backend logic and storage, with a middleware Express.js server acting as the communication bridge between Africa's Talking (USSD frontend) and the ICP.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The project consists of the following parts:

1. **Canisters (ICP)**  
   - `sikachainPhoneNumber`: Handles phone-number-based accounts, minting, sending, and user logic.
   - `sikachainInternetIdentity`: Identity-based canister (not fully implemented yet to avoid breaking user flow).

2. **Express.js Middleware (Node.js/TypeScript)**  
   Acts as the backend server that receives and responds to:
   - USSD webhooks from Africa‚Äôs Talking
   - SMS webhooks (for payment forwarding)
   - Routes calls to ICP canisters using DFINITY's SDK

3. **Africa‚Äôs Talking Sandbox (USSD Interface)**  
   Provides a USSD simulation using the code `*384*10305#` for testing on supported countries (e.g., Ghana).

4. **Payment Integration via SMS Forwarding**  
   While direct MTN Collections API integration is pending, payment is handled via SMS:
   - Users send money to a designated MTN number.
   - The confirmation SMS is forwarded to the backend.
   - The backend encodes transaction info into a **base64 coupon** and sends it back to the user as an SMS token for redemption via USSD.

## üöÄ Deployment

The middleware is deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app/), allowing public access to webhook routes and integration with the Africa‚Äôs Talking simulator.

You can test the app by going to Africa's Talking Sandbox and dialing:
*384*10305#

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **MTN Collections API integration** is not functional due to lack of required paperwork and approval.
- As a workaround, **SMS forwarding** is used:
   - Payments to a dedicated MTN number trigger a webhook.
   - A base64 token is generated and sent to the sender via SMS.
   - Users redeem tokens via USSD to mint Sika.
- Currently **sandbox-only** via Africa‚Äôs Talking.
